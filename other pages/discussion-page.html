  <h2 class = discussion-title-h2>10 Reasons Why I Love German Shepherds.</h2>

  <div class="body-div">

    <h2 class = "discussion-h2">Every German Shepherd is breathtaking.</h2>
    <h3 class = "discussion-h3">At the dog park, at dog conformation shows, and on the street, German Shepherds always stand out. That unmistakable saddleback coat is easy for most people to recognize, even those who do not consider themselves to be "dog people." A German Shepherd carries himself proudly, like a wolf, and has a graceful gait you wouldn't expect from a dog their size.</h3>

    <h2 class = "discussion-h2">German Shepherds are deeply loyal.</h2>
    <h3 class = "discussion-h3">Like most herding breeds, the German Shepherd has an unwavering focus on their job - for most, this might just be keeping a protective watch over their family. They don't rush to make friends with everyone they meet, though they'll happily warm up to good people once they've passed the "German Shepherd Sniff Test." .</h3>

    <h2 class = "discussion-h2">German Shepherds are problem solvers.</h2>
    <h3 class = "discussion-h3">They easily pick up any activity or trick with the right training. What's most impressive about the German Shepherd's intelligence is that they are ab le to use it independently to solve problems in their environment. Many learn to open doors, get into cabinets, and even undo the lock on their crate when given enough time to use their incredible brainpower. It comes in handy when they're given plenty of jobs and activities to put that brain to use, and can result in naughtiness if they're left with nothing to do. </h3>

    <h2 class = "discussion-h2">They're total drama queens.</h2>
    <h3 class = "discussion-h3">Most people think German Shepherds are tough, even scary, but you know better. Your German Shepherd is a big baby, especially when it comes to pooping outside in the rain, or hearing a clap of thunder outdoors.
    German Shepherds quickly pick up on which behaviors are the most effective at getting your attention, and you bet they'll use them over and over again. When it's time for dinner, you'll know it because they'll make a lot of noise, tipping at their empty bowl and looking at you expectantly as though to say, "Have you seen how empty my bowl is? It's been hours since breakfast. HOURS."</h3>

    <h2 class = "discussion-h2">German Shepherds hear everything.</h2>
    <h3 class = "discussion-h3">With those huge ears that they've taken two years to grow into, a German Shepherd picks up every sound in the house, from a door opening to the tiniest crinkle of a cheese wrapper. There's no keeping secrets from a Shepherd, but the good news is, they'll never narc on your late-night snacking, as long as you share a few choice bites. </h3>

    <h2 class = "discussion-h2">They are great work out buddies!</h2>
    <h3 class = "discussion-h3">German Shepherds can participate in almost any dog sport. If you have a German shepherd you know that you will never have to work out alone. Their energy and positive attitude will only motivate you to do more and try harder. </h3>

    <h2 class = "discussion-h2">A German Shepherd never forgets.</h2>
    <h3 class = "discussion-h3">German Shepherds have incredible memories, quickly picking up on paths and trails that you normally take them for walks on. They never forget about their friends, and will greet you happily whether you've been gone for 9 minutes or 9 months. They're also great at retaining tricks that they were taught years ago. </h3>

    <h2 class = "discussion-h2">They're extremely photogenic.</h2>
    <h3 class = "discussion-h3">A German Shepherd always takes the most majestic photos, whether you're at the top of the mountain or in front of a dumpster, they manage to make every photo look like the cover of an epic novel. If you don't consider yourself a photographer when you first get a Shepherd, you'll likely consider investing in a professional camera just so you can capture all of those captivating poses that just seem to come naturally to this dog. </h3>

    <h2 class = "discussion-h2">They adore children.</h2>
    <h3 class = "discussion-h3">When brought up as puppies around well-mannered children, German Shepherds make wonderful playmates for kids. Of course, kids should not be left unattended with them, and should be taught to treat them with respect. German Shepherds are protective of their kids as though they were their own, and many seem to have an instinct for being gentle around tiny people.</h3>

    <h2 class = "discussion-h2">German Shepherds don't get older - they get awesomer.</h2>
    <h3 class = "discussion-h3">As they age, German Shepherds become more mellow, but they always have that warmth in their eyes that hold your heart forever. </h3>
