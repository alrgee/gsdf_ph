  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <hr>

    <div class="body-div">

      <h3 class="intro-h3">Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight.</h3>

      <h3 class = "intro-h3">The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian in Great Britain and parts of Europe, is among the top 10 most popular dog breeds in the U.S., and probably one of the world's most recognized breeds. </h3>

      <h3 class = "intro-h3">There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.'</h3>

      <h3 class ="intro-h3"> As a herding dog, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles and acting. The German Shepherd was the third-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club in 2020, and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom in 2016.</h3>

      <h3 class ="intro-h3">The dog has even taken on the role of national hero. German Shepherds were the search and rescue dogs crawling through the ruins of the World Trade Center after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, looking for survivors and comforting rescue workers and families.</h3>

      <h3 class ="intro-h3">The German Shepherd may embody some of the best traits of dogs, but they're not for everyone. Originally bred to herd flocks all day, this is a high-energy dog who needs a lot of activity and exercise. Without it, they're likely to express their boredom and frustration in ways you don't like, such as barking and chewing.</h3>

      <h3 class ="intro-h3">The breed also has an aloof and sometimes suspicious nature—great for a watchdog, but not the sort of family dog who'll make guests feel welcome. However, if you expose a German Shepherd to many different situations and people starting in puppyhood, they can learn to take new people and circumstances in stride.</h3>

      <h3 class ="intro-h3">If you're adopting a puppy, you'll get a slightly different kind of German Shepherd depending on whether they're descended from dogs that come from American versus German breeders. In general, American breeders often aim to create dog show champions, and they breed more for that distinctive German Shepherd look than for distinctive German Shepherd talents.</h3>

      <h3 class ="intro-h3">Fans say that American-bred German Shepherds are calmer than their German counterparts, but critics say these dogs have lost some of their talents for working traditional German Shepherd jobs, and are more prone to behavior problems such as separation anxiety.</h3>

      <h3 class ="intro-h3">German breeders, on the other hand, breed for working abilities, as well as to fit the breed's traditional look. Before a German Shepherd is bred in Germany, they have to pass numerous tests to prove they measure up to the physical and mental benchmarks the breed is known for. German Shepherd Dogs from Germany tend to have a more energetic and driven personality.</h3>

      <h3 class ="intro-h3">However, the only way to guarantee what kind of dog you're going to get is to spend time with them. So get to the shelter and meet your new best friend before you even take them home!</h3>
